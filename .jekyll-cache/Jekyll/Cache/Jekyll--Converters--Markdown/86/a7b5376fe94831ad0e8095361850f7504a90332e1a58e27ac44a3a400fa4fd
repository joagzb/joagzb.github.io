<h2 id="proyect-experience">Proyect experience</h2>

<p>I was hire by ‚ÄúAmacom Media‚Äù which is a Communications company that offers TV, Internet, radio and news services.</p>

<p>They are going through several automatization processes. One of them is implementing new online payment gateways so they‚Äôve hired me to do it.</p>

<p>They needed an application from scratch: Database design, back-end architecture and frontend designn and I have to choose PHP-Laravel stack owing to they already had an API service built with laravel.</p>

<p>My team were compound by three technicians: A server administrator, a Database administrator and me as a fullstack developer.</p>

<p>Before start programming, I decided to start designing a system scheme using UML to show requests paths, data flow chart and system‚Äôs requirements. Then, I made a User-case, gannt and database diagram to keep a better understanding what the proyect‚Äôs about, keep tracking goals and leave them as a part of Documentation for futures proyects.</p>

<p>After finishing and validating UML Schemes, I had started programming the web app following the data model and once finished, I ran some automatization testing and real-payments tests. Of course I found some bugs, therefore, I had to fix them all.</p>

<p>Finally, the web app finished sucessfully and it was uploaded to the server to put it on production.</p>
