## Proyect experience

I was hire by "Amacom Media" which is a Communications company that offers TV, Internet, radio and news services.

They are going through several automatization processes. One of them is implementing new online payment gateways so they've hired me to do it.

They needed an application from scratch: Database design, back-end architecture and frontend designn and I have to choose PHP-Laravel stack owing to they already had an API service built with laravel.

My team were compound by three technicians: A server administrator, a Database administrator and me as a fullstack developer.

Before start programming, I decided to start designing a system scheme using UML to show requests paths, data flow chart and system's requirements. Then, I made a User-case, gannt and database diagram to keep a better understanding what the proyect's about, keep tracking goals and leave them as a part of Documentation for futures proyects.

After finishing and validating UML Schemes, I had started programming the web app following the data model and once finished, I ran some automatization testing and real-payments tests. Of course I found some bugs, therefore, I had to fix them all.

Finally, the web app finished sucessfully and it was uploaded to the server to put it on production.
